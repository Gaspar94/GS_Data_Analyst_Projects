# The future of the engine.
This project has the aim to determine which is the future fuel for cars.

Using different data I will try to answer the following questions:

1) Is it an electric future or will be the hydrogen the emperor?
2) Is it actually over the diesel or has it a market segment ?
3) Which of the automotive manufacturers will be the king ? Are the chinese going to rule in the electric segment or the bet of Toyota for diesel motors with an hydrogen future be successful?
